# C++ Project template with SFML and Imgui  
This is a template to try and reduce the barrier to entry for working with the great libraries SFML and ImGui.  
Older versions of this repo were strictly 2D but considering how much I struggled with setting up a camera and reasonable controls for a 3D legacy OpenGL scene I put together a few primitives for the budding developer to use. In future I may update this to use a newer version of opengl when I myself learn how to use it. In the meantime check out this demo of Imgui and a 3D OpenGL scene working together.
